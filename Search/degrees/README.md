## Degrees of Separation

This project explores graph search algorithms to determine the shortest connection between two actors based on shared movie appearances. Using breadth-first search (BFS), it models Hollywood as a network and finds the minimal path of co-starring relationships between any two individuals. Includes both small and large datasets for testing scalability.
